\f3INTRODUCTION\fP
.sp 1v
Two document types provide information about \*(5):  manuals
and guides.
The manuals describe commands, facilities, features, and
error messages of the system.  The guides provide supplemental
details and instructions for system implementation,
administration, and use.
.P
\f3General.\fP
This manual is designed to
provide a description of all \*(5)
error messages
which appear on the \s-1EXOR\s+1macs Development System.
Corrective actions and additional references for each message
are also included.
.P
Hardware references used in this manual are defined as follows:
.sp .5v
.in +2m
cm16	16Mb Cartridge Module Drive
.br
cm80	80Mb Cartridge Module Drive
.br
fl8	8-inch Floppy Disk Drive
.br

.in -2m
.P
Many of the error message entries refer to the system
description file and its contents.
For more information on this file, see 
the ``Setting Up \*(5)'' section of the \*(Ag.
.P
The term ``support organization'' appears frequently throughout this
manual.
It refers to the local lab support personnel in your own
organization.
.P
\f3Document Conventions\fP.
All \*(5) error messages are included in this manual.
Messages which begin with variables are listed first, followed by
alphabetical entries of the remaining messages.
One entry appears per page.
An index is included in the rear of this manual for easy reference.
The format of each error message entry follows the template below.
.Nm "Error Message  \*(Eo"
.Ds
This section includes a detailed description of the error message.
It may also reference documents in which further information on the
error can be found.
.Ac
This section contains probable causes for each error, if applicable,
and/or corrective action(s) that should be taken to alleviate the
problem.
Messages that require no action are denoted as information-only
messages.
.Rf
This section contains the name(s) of the \*(5) source code module(s)
that produce the error message.
.P
(Processor(s)) appears if the error message does not pertain
equally to \s-1M68000\s+1, \s-1PDP\s+1-11,
and \s-1VAX\s+1-11 processors.
It is in the form:
.DS
	(processor-type(s) only)
.DE
where \fIprocessor-type\fP is the name(s) of the
processor(s) on which the error can occur. 
General categories such as \s-1M68000\s+1 and
\s-1VAX\s+1-11 refer to any of the processors
in the specified series.
The category of DEC refers to all \s-1PDP\s+1-11
and \s-1VAX\s+1-11 processors.  
References to processors other than \s-1M68000\s+1 have been
included only for purposes of
comparison and transition.

.P
Messages which appear in this manual use the following
language conventions.
.sp .5v
.in +2m
.B Boldface
strings are literals and are to be typed just as they appear.
.sp .5v
.I Italic
strings represent substitutable argument prototypes and
program names found elsewhere in the manual.
.sp .5v
.ne 2
Square brackets [] around an argument prototype indicate that the
argument is optional.  When an argument prototype is given as 
.I name
or
.IR file ,
it always refers to a
.IR file name.
.sp .5v
Ellipses ... are used to show that the previous argument prototype
may be repeated.
.sp .5v
A final convention is used by the commands themselves.  An argument
beginning with a minus -, plus +, or equal sign = is often taken
to be some type of flag argument, even if it appears in a position
where a filename could appear.  Therefore, it is unwise to have
files whose names begin with -, +, or =.
.in -2m
.P
\*(5) manuals are organized as alphabetized entries within tabbed
sections.  The \fI\*(6) User's Manual\fP contains sections 1 through 6.
The \*(Am contains sections 1M, 7, and 8.
Throughout this documentation, references to these manuals are
given as \fIname\fP(section).  For example, 
\fIchroot\fP(1M) is a reference to the \fIchroot\fP entry in
section 1M of the \*(Am.
.P
\f3Operator Notes\fP.
An operational difference exists between execution of \*(5) 
on the \s-1EXOR\s+1macs and \s-1DEC\s+1 machines.
System dumps are written to disk on the \s-1EXOR\s+1macs.
On \s-1DEC\s+1 processors, system dumps are written to tape.
Procedures for taking system dumps can be found in 
\fIcrash\fP(8).
