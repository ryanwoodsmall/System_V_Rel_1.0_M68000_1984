.NM "\f2string\f3 on bad dev \f2#\f3(8)\f1  \*(Do"
.Ds
A problem has been detected with a file system on a block-type device
whose major device number exceeds the number of block device drivers
generated in the system.
The \f2string\f1 may be one of the following:
\f3bad block\f1, \f3bad count\f1, \f3bad free count\f1, \f3no space\f1, or \f3out of inodes\f1.
The \f2#\f1 represents the minor device number.
.Ac
The main concern is that the major device number exceeds the number of
block device drivers generated in the system.
Probable causes for this include both software and hardware problems.
Check any new device drivers which have not been completely debugged
or any \*(5) device driver which has been modified without authorization.
Also, ensure that the configuration information in the system description
file is correct.
If none of the above apply, suspect bad hardware and contact your support
organization.
The corrective action for the file system problem can be found in the
ACTION section for message:

.Ac
Determine the offending drive and corresponding file system from
the controller (\f3ctl\f1) \f2#\f1, \f3drive \f2#\f1, and \f3slice \f2#\f1
given in the message.
Unmount the file system.
If it is the root file system, go to single-user mode.
Check the file system using the \f2fsck\f1(1M) command.
If the offending file system is beyond repair, restore it from
backup disk or tape.

.Ds
At system initialization time, it was found that too much memory
was being allocated for messages.
Messages are currently unusable.
.Ac
Check the MSGSEG and MSGSSZ entries in the system description file.
MSGSEG is the number of segments to allocate, and MSGSSZ is the size
each segment should be.
The product of these two numbers, therefore, is the amount of memory
to allocate for messages.
When this amount exceeds the amount of memory currently
available in the machine,
the above message will appear during system
booting.
The system size must be reduced either by modifying the above
entries or by other means.
Then a new system must be generated and booted.
If the above solutions are not acceptable, more memory must
be added to the machine.

.Ds
One of the tables, mapped through the system \f2malloc\f1(3C) mechanism,
has overflowed.
The first number indicates the address of the table.
By searching for this address in the system namelist, the name of
the offending table can be discovered.
The second number is the number of items lost, and the last number
is the starting address of the above items.
.Ac
Increase the number of entries currently allocated for the offending
table in your system description file
and generate a new system.
Boot the new system.

Insufficient space was found on the swap device when attempting
to swap out a given process or a copy of a pure text image.
The number of blocks requested is given.
Preceding this will be the message:
\f3WARNING: swap space running out, needed \f2#\f3 blocks\f1.
After this warning an attempt is made to clean up the swap area.
If this action is unsuccessful, the \f3DANGER\f1 message will appear.
The system may hang or crash.
If swap space becomes available,
it may recover and resume normal operation.
.Ac
If the system hangs or crashes, reboot.
This error may be caused by an operating system or user program
that has not been completely debugged.
Check any such programs.
It can also be caused by an excessive user load on the system.
If this is the case, increase the amount of swap space specified
in your system description file and generate a new system.
Boot the new system.
