This message can indicate a software or hardware error.
It may be caused by a corrupted file system.
To check the state of any file system suspected to be corrupt,
unmount it and check with the

If it is the root file system, go to single-user mode to check it.
This error can also be generated by new device drivers which have not been
completely debugged or by standard \*(5) device drivers which
