.NM "\f3Panicked\f1 \*(Do"
.Ds
This message is printed after a power fail condition if a panic occurred
before or during recovery.
Prior to this message, a system panic message \f3panic: \f2panicstr\f1
should appear on the console.
.Ac
This message indicates two problems: the power failure and
the panic.
The first concern is the power failure.
Refer to the ACTION section for the message \f3Power fail \f2#\f1
for details.
To correct the panic condition, refer to the ACTION section
for the specified panic.
Although it is possible that the power failure may have caused
the panic, it is best to investigate each condition separately.

.NM "\f3Power fail \f2#\f1 \*(Do"
.Ds
A power fail condition has been detected.
If power fail recovery has been specified in the system configuration,
the initialization process will be informed.
The \f2#\f1 is incremented each time a power fail
occurs and the recovery is successful.
It is reset to zero during each system reboot.
.Ac
If the power parameter in the system configuration file has a value
of 1, power fail restart is initiated.
If its value is 0 (default), automatic restart is inhibited.
If power fail restart is enabled and the system continues to run,
recovery is successful and all should be fine.
Do not halt the system, because this would be counterproductive
to the power fail recovery.
Determine the cause of the power failure and take the
appropriate steps to see that it is corrected.
If power fail restart is enabled and the system fails to recover,
determine the cause of the problem, see that it is corrected, and
then reboot the system.
If power fail restart is disabled, the message \f3Stopped\f1
appears on the console.
Again, determine the cause of the failure, correct it, and reboot
the system.

This message is printed after a power fail condition if power fail recovery 
has not been specified.
The system is halted.

Determine the cause of the power failure and take 
the appropriate steps to correct the problem.
Reboot the system.

.NM "\f3stray interrupt at \f2#\f1  \*(Do"
.Ds
A device has interrupted through an unexpected vector on the
\s-1VERSA\s+1bus (\s-1M68000\s+1) or \s-1MASSBUS\s+1 (\s-1VAX\s+1).
The vector will be printed in hexadecimal on an \s-1EXOR\s+1macs or \s-1VAX\s+1.
The vector printed is usually the correct value for the device,
unless \f2#\f1 is \f30\f1, which is a reserved location.
.Ac
This error can be caused by a device specified at an incorrect vector
in the system description file.
If this is the case, make the necessary corrections and
boot the new system.
If the above does not apply or the vector is \f30\f1, suspect
hardware problems and
contact your support organization.

.Ds
The above messages are printed on the system console during the startup
procedure when booting \*(5).
The value for \f3real mem\f1 represents
the actual size in bytes of the memory on your machine.
The value for \f3avail mem\f1 represents
the amount of memory available for user programs after the \*(5)
operating system has been loaded.
.Ac
These messages are for information only.
No action is necessary unless the number of bytes of memory 
drops from a previous boot for no apparent reason.
If this occurs, some of the memory may have become inaccessible and
should be investigated.

.NM "\f3WARNING: swap space running out, needed \f2#\f3 blocks\f1"
.Ds
Insufficient space was found on the swap device when attempting to
swap out a given process or a copy of a pure text image.
The number of blocks requested is given.
After the warning is given, an attempt is made to clean up
the swap area.
If this is unsuccessful, the message
\f3DANGER: out of swap space, needed \f2#\f3 blocks\f1
will appear.
The system may hang or crash.
If swap space becomes available, it may recover
and resume normal operation.
.Ac
If the system hangs or crashes, reboot.
This error may be caused by an operating system or user program
that has not been completely debugged.
Check any such programs.
It can also be caused by an excessive user load on the system.
If this is the case, increase the amount of swap space specified
in your system description file and generate a new system.
Boot the new system.

An attempt was made to free the core and swap out the currently

The \f2#\f1 is the process number.
.Ac
This message can indicate software or hardware problems.
Check any new device drivers which have not been completely
debugged or any \*(5) device driver which has been modified
without authorization.
Also, ensure that the configuration information in the system
description file is correct.
If none of the above apply, suspect bad hardware and contact
your support organization.
