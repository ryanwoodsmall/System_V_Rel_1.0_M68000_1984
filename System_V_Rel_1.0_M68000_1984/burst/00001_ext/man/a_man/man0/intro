\f3INTRODUCTION\fP
.sp 1
.tr ~
.H 1 "GENERAL"
The 
.I "Administrator's Manual"
is intended to supplement the information contained in the
.I "\*(6) User's Manual"
and to provide an easy reference volume for those who must 
administer \*(5).  Accordingly, only those commands and descriptions
deemed appropriate for system administrators have been included here.
.sp
.H 1 "ADMINISTRATOR'S MANUAL ORGANIZATION"
.P
.H 2 "Description of Contents"
.P
The manual is divided into three sections:
.P
.B "Section 1"
(``System Maintenance Commands and Application Programs'')
contains system maintenance programs such as 
.I "fsck, mkfs,"
etc., which generally reside in the directory
.B /etc;
these entries carry a sub-class designation of ``1M'' for cross referencing
reasons.
.P
.B "Section 7"
(``Special Files'') 
discusses the characteristics of each system file that actually refer
to an input/output device.  The names in this section generally refer
to device names for the hardware, rather than to the names of the
special files themselves.
.P
.B "Section 8"
(``System Maintenance Procedures'')
discusses crash recovery and boot procedures, facility descriptions, etc.
.sp
.H 2 "Section Organization"
.P
Each section consists of a number of independent entries of a page or so
each.  The name of the entry appears in the upper corners of its pages.
Entries within each section are alphabetized, with the exception
of the introductory entry that begins each section.  The page numbers
of each entry start at 1.  Some entries may describe several routines,
commands, etc.  In such cases, the entry appears only once,
alphabetized under its major name.
.P
The
.IR "\*(6) User's Manual" ,
which contains sections 1 - 6, is organized
in the same manner as this
.IR "Administrator's Manual" .
Throughout the documentation, references to the contents of either
manual are given as 
.BR name (section).
For example, 
.BR chroot (1M)
is a reference to the \fIchroot\fP entry in section 1M of the
.I "Administrator's Manual".
.P
A table of contents and a permuted index derived from that table
precede Section 1M.  The permuted index contains entries from both the  
.I "\*(6) User's Manual" 
and this volume, and on each ``index'' line,
the title of the entry to which that
line refers is followed by the appropriate section number in
parentheses.  This is important because there is considerable
duplication of names among the sections, arising principally from
commands that exist only to exercise a particular system call.
.sp
.H 2 "Entry Format"
.P
All entries are based on a common format, not all of whose parts
always appear:
.P
.in +2m
\f3NAME\f1 gives the name(s) of the entry and briefly states its
purpose.
.P
\f3SYNOPSIS\f1 summarizes the use of the program being described.
.P
\f3DESCRIPTION\f1 provides additional information about the
program or facility outlined in the ``Name'' and ``Synopsis'' parts.
.P
\f3EXAMPLE\f1 gives an example(s) of usage, where appropriate.
.P
\f3FILES\f1 gives the filenames that are built into the program.
.P
\f3SEE ALSO\f1 gives pointers to related information.
.P
\f3DIAGNOSTICS\f1 discusses the diagnostic indications that may be
produced.  Messages that are self-explanatory are not
listed.
.P
\f3WARNINGS\f1 points out potential pitfalls.
.P
\f3BUGS\f1 gives known bugs and sometimes deficiencies.  Occasionally,
the suggested fix is also described.
.in -2m
.sp
.H 2 "Conventions"
.P
A few conventions are used, particularly in Section 1 (``Commands''):
.P
.in +2m
.B Boldface
strings are literals and are to be typed just as they appear.
.P
.I Italic
strings usually represent substitutable argument prototypes and
program names found elsewhere in the manual.  Note that this
convention is not used in the ``SYNOPSIS'' or ``SEE ALSO'' part.
.P
Square brackets [] around an argument prototype indicate that the
argument is optional.  When an argument prototype is given as 
.I name
or
.IR file ,
it always refers to a
.IR file name.
.P
Ellipses ... are used to show that the previous argument prototype
may be repeated.
.P
A final convention is used by the commands themselves.  An argument
beginning with a minus -, plus +, or equal sign = is often taken
to be some type of flag argument, even if it appears in a position
where a filename could appear.  Therefore, it is unwise to have
files whose names begin with -, +, or =.
.in -2m
.sp
On most systems, all entries are available online via the
.IR man (1)
command.
