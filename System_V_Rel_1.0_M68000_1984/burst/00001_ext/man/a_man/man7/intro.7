.SH NAME
intro \- introduction to special files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.hw \*(5)  
This section describes various special files
that refer to specific
hardware
peripherals and
\*(5) device drivers.
The names of the entries are generally
derived from
names for the hardware,
as opposed to
the names of the special files themselves.
Characteristics of both the hardware device and the
corresponding
\*(5) device driver are discussed where applicable.
.SH BUGS
While the names of the entries
generally refer to vendor
hardware names, in certain cases
these names are seemingly arbitrary for various
historical reasons.
