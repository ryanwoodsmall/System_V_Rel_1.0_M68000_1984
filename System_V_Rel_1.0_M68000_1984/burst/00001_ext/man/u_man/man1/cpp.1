cpp \- the C language preprocessor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /lib/cpp [
option ...
.B ]
.B [

.B [

.B ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Cpp\^
is the C language preprocessor which is invoked as the
first pass of any C compilation using the
.IR cc (1)
command.  The output of
.I cpp\^
is designed to be in a form acceptable as input
to the next pass of the C compiler.
As the C language evolves,
.I cpp\^
and the rest of the C compilation package will be
modified to follow these changes.
Therefore, the use of
.I cpp\^
other than in this framework is not suggested.
The preferred way to invoke
.I cpp\^
is through the
.IR cc (1)
command since the functionality of
.I cpp\^
may someday be moved elsewhere.  See
.IR m4 (1)
for a general macro processor.
.PP
.I Cpp\^
optionally accepts two filenames as arguments.
.I Ifile\^
is the input and
.I ofile\^
is the output
for the preprocessor.  They default to standard input
and standard output if not supplied.
.PP
The following \f2options\f1 to
.I cpp\^
are recognized:
.TP
.B \-P
Preprocess the input without producing the line control
information used by the next pass of the C compiler.
.TP
.B \-C
Pass along
all comments except those found on
.I cpp
directive lines.
By default,
.I cpp\^
strips C-style comments.
.TP
.BI \-U name\^
Remove any initial definition of
.IR name ,
where
.I name\^
is a reserved symbol
that is predefined by the particular preprocessor.
The current list of these possibly reserved symbols includes:
.PD 0
.ne 3v
.RS 10
.TP 21
operating system:
ibm, gcos, os, tss, unix
.TP
hardware:
interdata, pdp11, u370, u3b, vax, m68k
.TP
\s-1UNIX\s+1 System variant:
.SM RES\*S,
.SM RT
.RE
.PD
.TP
.BI \-D name\^
.PD 0
.TP
.BI \-D name=def\^
Define
.I name\^
as if by a
.B #define
directive.  If no
.I =def\^
is given,
.I name\^
is defined as 1.
.PD
.TP
.BI \-I dir\^
Change the algorithm for searching for
.B #include
files
whose names do not begin with \f3/\f1
to look in
.I dir\^
before looking in the directories on the standard list.
When this option is used,
.B #include
files whose names are enclosed in \f3"\|"\f1
are searched for
first in the directory of the
.I ifile\^
argument,
then in directories named in 
.B \-I
options,
and last in directories on a standard list.
For
.B #include
files whose names are enclosed in
.BR <> ,
the directory of the
.I ifile\^
argument is not searched.
.PP
Two special names are understood by
.IR cpp .
The name
.B _\s-1LINE\s+1_
is defined as the current line number (as a decimal integer) as known by
.IR cpp ,
and
.B _\s-1FILE\s+1_
is defined as the current filename (as a C string) as known by
.I cpp.\^
They can be used anywhere (including in macros) just as any
other defined name.
.PP
All
.I cpp\^
directives start with lines begun by
.BR # .
The directives are:
.TP
.BI #define " name" " " token-string
Replace subsequent instances of
.I name\^
with
.IR token-string .
.TP
\f3#define\f2 name\f3(\f2 arg\f3, ...,\f2 arg\f3 )\f2 token-string\f1
Notice that there can be no space between
.I name
and the
.BR ( .
Replace subsequent instances of
.I name
followed by a
.BR ( ,
a list of comma-separated tokens, and a
.B )
by
.I token-string
where each occurrence of an
.I arg
in the
.I token-string
is replaced by the corresponding token in the comma-separated list.
.TP
.BI #undef " name"
Cause the definition of
.I name
(if any) to be forgotten from now on.
.TP
\f3#include\f1 "filename"
.PD 0
.TP
.BI #include " " < filename >
Include at this point the contents of
.I filename
(which will then be run through
.IR cpp ).
When the
.BI < filename >
notation is used,
.I filename
is only searched for in the standard places.
See the
.B \-I
option above for more detail.
.PD
.TP
\f3#line\f2 integer-constant "filename"
Causes
.I cpp
to generate line control information for the next pass of the
C compiler.
.I Integer-constant
is the line number of the next line
and
.I filename
is the file where it comes from.
If \f2"filename"\f1 is not given, the current filename is unchanged.
.TP
.B #endif
.br
Ends a section of lines begun by a test directive
.RB ( #if ,
.BR #ifdef ,
or
.BR #ifndef ).
Each test directive must have a matching
.BR #endif .
.TP
.BI #ifdef " name"
The lines following appear in the output if and only if
.I name
has been the subject of a previous
.B #define
without being the subject of an intervening
.BR #undef .
.TP
.BI #ifndef " name"
The lines following do not appear in the output if and only if
.I name
has been the subject of a previous
.B #define
without being the subject of an intervening
.BR #undef .
.TP
.BI #if " constant-expression"
Lines following appear in the output if and only if the
.I constant-expression
evaluates to non-zero.
All binary non-assignment C operators, the
.B ?:
operator, the unary
.BR \(mi ,
.BR ! ,
and
.B ~
operators are all legal in
.IR constant-expression .
The precedence of the operators is the same as
defined by the C language.
There is also a unary operator
.BR defined ,
which can be used in
.I constant-expression
in these two forms:
.BI defined " " ( " name " )
or
.BI defined " name" .
This allows the utility of
.BR #ifdef " and " #ifndef
in a
.B #if
directive.
Only these operators, integer constants, and names which
are known by
.I cpp
should be used in
.IR constant-expression .
In particular, the
.B sizeof
operator is not available.
.TP
.B #else
Reverses the notion of the test directive that
matches this directive.  If lines previous to
this directive are ignored, the following lines
appear in the output.
If lines previous to this directive are not ignored,
the following lines do not appear in the output.
.PP
The test directives and the possible
.B #else
directives can be nested.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.PP
The error messages produced by
.I cpp\^
are self-explanatory.  The line number and filename
where the error occurred are printed along with the diagnostic.
.SH NOTES
When newline characters were found in argument lists for macros
to be expanded, previous versions of
.I cpp\^
put out the newlines as they were found and expanded.
The current version of
.I cpp\^
replaces these newlines with blanks to alleviate problems that the
previous versions had when this occurred.
