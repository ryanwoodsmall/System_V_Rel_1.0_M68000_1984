.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Nlist\^
examines the name list in
the executable file whose name is pointed to by
.IR filename ;
it selectively extracts a
list of values and puts them in the array of \fInlist\fP
structures pointed to by
.IR nl .
The name list
.I nl\^
consists of
an array of structures containing names of variables,
types, and values.
The list is terminated with a null name;
i.e., a null string is in the name position of the structure.
Each variable name is
looked up in the name list of
the file.
If the name is found, the type and value of the
name are inserted in the next two fields.
If the name is not found, both entries are set to 0.
See
.IR a.out (4)
for a discussion of the symbol table structure.
.PP
This subroutine is useful for
examining the system name list kept in
the file
.BR /unix .
In this way programs can obtain system addresses
that are up to date.

a.out(4).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All
type entries are set to 0 if the file cannot be read
or if it doesn't contain a valid name list.
.PP
.I Nlist\^
returns \-1 upon error; otherwise it returns 0.
